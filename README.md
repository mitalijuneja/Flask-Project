# Flask-Project
1006 Flask Final Project

Mitali Juneja (mj2944)
Final assignment


Note = I changed the name to uni-final after making most of my commits and when I pushed it, it created that as a new folder alongside final, which I was working on originally
"mj2944-final" has my actual final work, but I wanted to leave "final" in the repository to make sure the progress through the multiple commits could still be viewed

2. implemented stock visualization route that asks for some stock information (stock_form.html), uses python wrapper for alphavantage web api to calculate some information, makes and saves a plot (stock_vis.py), displays everything in html (stock_vis.html)
